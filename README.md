### STEP 2 Install git
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files,

look to the user like ordinary Python packages based on the distutils.

additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library.

    sudo pip3 install setuptools

### STEP 4 Install virtualenv
virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments containing their own copy of
python , pip , and their own place to keep libraries installed from PyPI.
It's designed to allow you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies 
at the same time on the same machine.
